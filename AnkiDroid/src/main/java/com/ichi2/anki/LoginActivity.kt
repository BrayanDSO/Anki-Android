/**
 * Activity used to log in into an AnkiWeb account, which can:
 *
 * * Log in
 * * Reset the password
 * * Sign up
 *
 * [EXTRA_HIDE_REGISTER] hides the sign up option, which can be useful
 * for a 'load from AnkiWeb' flow, in which we only wanted to encourage an
 * existing user to sync from AnkiWeb, to ensure that they don't have two collections,
 * causing a sync conflict.
 *
 * Most responsibilities are on [MyAccount] and [LoggedInFragment].
 * This class only is necessary while [DeckPicker] and other callers can't handle using Fragments
